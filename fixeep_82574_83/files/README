Packet drop issues may occur in some 82574 and 82583-based adapters. Neither the
e1000e driver nor the hardware itself show any packets being dropped, however
packets ARE actually being dropped.

If you encounter packet drop issues in an 82574 or 82583-based adapter, you can
verify that your adapter needs the fix by using ethtool:

 # ethtool -e eth0
 Offset          Values
 ------          ------
 0x0000          00 1b 21 51 39 8c 20 0d 46 f7 a1 10 ff ff ff ff
 0x0010          29 e6 02 64 6b 02 00 00 86 80 0c 15 ff ff 58 9c
                                                           ^^

The value at offset 0x001e (58) has bit 1 unset. This enables the problematic
power saving feature. In this case, the EEPROM needs to read "5a" at offset
0x001e.

A one-time EEPROM fix is available as a shell script. This script will verify
that the adapter is applicable to the fix and whether the fix is needed or not.
If the fix is required, it applies the change to the EEPROM and updates the
checksum. The user must reboot the system after applying the fix if changes
were made to the EEPROM.

Example output of the script:

 # bash fixeep-82574_83.sh eth0
 eth0: is a "82583V Gigabit Network Connection"
 This fixup is applicable to your hardware
 executing command: ethtool -E eth0 magic 0x150c8086 offset 0x1e value 0x5a
 Change made. You *MUST* reboot your machine before changes take effect!
